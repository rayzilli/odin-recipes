    <h2>After losing a bet to Erol Morris, Werner Herzog eats his shoe.</h2>
    <p> 
        The importance of having a good shoe Herzog takes to heart. Herzog once walked from Munich to Paris in the dead of the winter. It is unclear where the shoes used for this stew had been walked in but one thing is clear; they were very well worn and no doubt added to the flavor of the stew. What follows is a shoe stew as concocted by Werner Herzog and chef Alice Waters.
